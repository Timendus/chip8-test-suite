# CHIP-8 test suite

_A single ROM image containing six distinct tests that will aid you in developing
your own CHIP-8, SCHIP or XO-CHIP interpreter (or "emulator")_

* [Download the ROM here](./bin/chip8-test-suite.ch8?raw=true), give it a spin and
see if your interpreter is doing the right thing<sup>[1]</sup>! ðŸ˜„
* Or [run the test suite in Octo](https://timendus.github.io/chip8-test-suite/) to
see what it **should** be doing ðŸ™„ (it's set to "Cosmac VIP" CHIP-8 mode)

<sup>[1]</sup> If you've only just started developing your interpreter, please
see the chapter on [Auto-starting a specific
test](#auto-starting-a-specific-test) on how you can bypass the menu and
immediately jump to specific tests! If your interpreter has been fully
implemented correctly, you should expect to be able to navigate all the tests
through a graphical menu, and see them all pass, like in the animated screenshot
below:

## Introduction

I found it hard to find reliable sources on what is the right behaviour and what
is not, especially with the subtle differences between the original "Cosmac VIP"
CHIP-8 and the HP84's SCHIP (or "superchip"). Now that I have written and ported
a couple of interpreters as well as a few programs and games for the platform, I
thought it was time to put that knowledge into code.

If you're having issues with your interpreter, you can find help in the [EmuDev
discord channel `#chip-8`](https://discord.gg/dkmJAes). If you discover a
problem with this test ROM, feel free to file an issue or open a pull request.
It's open source, licensed under the GPLv3, and you're welcome to contribute.

## Controls

When you see the CHIP-8 splash screen, press any CHIP-8 key to get to the main
menu:

![The menu for the CHIP-8 test suite](./pictures/menu.png)

In the menu, you can press any of the numbers 1 to 5 on the CHIP-8 keypad to
jump to the corresponding test. Note that on a PC keyboard the keys `Q` and `W`
generally map to 4 and 5, not the numeric keys.

Alternatively, you can move the cursor up and down with CHIP-8 keys `E` and `F`
and select an item with `A`. On a PC keyboard those generally map to `F` and `V`
to move the cursor and `Z` to select. This feature mainly exists so people
implementing interpreters for platforms with limited input devices (like a game
controller) can map their buttons to those CHIP-8 keys and have an intuitive
interface too.

## Auto-starting a specific test

If you're just starting out and you have very few opcodes implemented, or if you
want to repeat a test often or even automate them, having to use the graphical
menu and the keys often just gets in the way.

In that case, you can force the ROM to immediately start a specific test by
setting a magic value in RAM. It will then skip waiting for a keypress and the
menu entirely. To do so:

  1. Load the ROM file in memory at address `0x200` (`512`) like you normally do
  2. Set the specific test you wish to run by loading a value between `1` and
     `5` in memory at address `0x1FF` (`511`)
  3. Start execution of the ROM from address `0x200` like you normally do

Note that your interpreter needs to support at least these opcodes for this
feature to succeed in starting the requested test:

  * `ANNN` - Load index register with immediate value
  * `FX65` - Load register(s) from memory _(only `F065`, if that makes things
    easier for you)_
  * `4XNN` - Skip next instruction if unequal _(again, only `40NN` in practice)_
  * `1NNN` - Jump

## About the tests

### CHIP-8 splash screen

The first test is a very simple splash screen. It is very similar to the often
used [IBM ROM](#ibm-logo), but it is actually a bit easier to get running.
First, it doesn't use the "add value to register" opcode (`7XNN`) and second it
only draws aligned sprites to the screen (the X coordinate is always a multiple
of 8). So if you use an array of bytes for your display buffer, you don't have
to shift the bits of the sprite to align with the buffer.

![CHIP-8 logo, shown on the display](./pictures/chip-8-logo.png)

Run the ROM for 39 cycles to see this splash screen on the display.

This first test can tell you if you're interpreting these opcodes properly:

  * `00E0` - Clear the screen
  * `6XNN` - Load normal register with immediate value
  * `ANNN` - Load index register with immediate value
  * `DXYN` - Draw sprite to screen (only aligned)

### IBM logo

The first test that is in the menu is the classic IBM ROM. If the splash screen
works as expected, this test should be pretty easy to pass, but it is a rite of
passage for any CHIP-8 developer.

I did not write this ROM, it's probably decades old and I'm not sure who wrote
it so I can't really credit them. The code in this suite is a re-implementation
in Octo-mnemonics by my own hand, but it compiles to the exact same bytes as the
original.

![IBM logo, shown on the display](./pictures/ibm-logo.png)

If the graphical menu works for you, just select "IBM LOGO" from the menu.
Otherwise:

Load the value `1` into memory at `0x1FF`, load the ROM in memory starting from
`0x200` and start your interpreter. Run the ROM for 64 cycles to see the IBM
logo on the display. If you can see the IBM logo, you are properly interpreting
these opcodes in addition to the opcodes used by the [CHIP-8 splash
screen](#chip-8-splash-screen):

  * To get to the IBM logo code from the CHIP-8 splash screen using the
    [Auto-start feature](#auto-starting-a-specific-test):
    * `1NNN` - Jump
    * `FX65` - Load register(s) from memory
    * `4XNN` - Skip next instruction if unequal
  * To show the IBM logo:
    * `7XNN` - Add immediate value to normal register
    * `DXYN` - Draw sprite to screen (un-aligned)

### Corax89's opcode test

This ROM is also a famous one, [written by
Corax89](https://github.com/corax89/chip8-test-rom). Many people use this ROM to
prove to themselves that their interpreter runs as it should. However, there are
a couple of [minor issues with the
ROM](https://github.com/corax89/chip8-test-rom/pulls) and Corax89 doesn't really
seem to be maintaining this ROM anymore. So I've taken the liberty to include it
in this suite, with those issues fixed and some minor cosmetic improvements.

To auto-start this test, load the value `2` into memory at `0x1FF`, load the ROM
in memory starting from `0x200` and start your interpreter. After a while you
should be seeing this screen:

![Corax89's opcode test](./pictures/corax89.png)

The codes on the screen correspond to the functioning of these opcodes:

```
3XNN	00EE	8XY5
4XNN	8XY0	8XYE
5XY0	8XY1	8XY6
7XNN	8XY2	FX55
9XY0	8XY3	FX33
2NNN	8XY4	1NNN
```

If you see `OK`, they're at least somewhat functional in the happy path. If you
see `NO` you can be sure that you have an issue with that opcode.

If you are having trouble figuring out how each opcode is supposed to behave,
check out [Tobias' guide](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/#instructions).

### Flags test

This test is an adaptation of the [maths tests I
wrote](https://github.com/Timendus/silicon8/tree/main/tests) for my interpreter
[Silicon8](https://github.com/Timendus/silicon8). It checks to see if your math
operations function properly on some given set of input values. But more
importantly: it checks to see if you set the flag register `vF` properly when
running those opcodes, and if you don't mess up `vF` too early (when `vF` is
used as one of the operands). This is often an issue as the flags are pretty
unintuitive and fairly hard to debug.

To auto-start this test, load the value `3` into memory at `0x1FF`, load the ROM
in memory starting from `0x200` and start your interpreter. After a while you
should be seeing this screen:

![The flags test](./pictures/flags.png)

You should see the above on your screen. Each code on the screen corresponds to
an opcode, and shows if the output value is correct (first checkmark), if the
flag is correct (second checkmark) and if the order in which the `vF` register
is read and written to is correct (third and fourth checkmarks). If you see a cross instead
of a checkmark in any of these spots, you have an issue in your interpreter
logic.

First, a note on the third and fourth checkmarks, for the `vF` order: This checks to see if
an instruction where `vF` is one of the operands (like `v0 += vF` / `0x80F4`)
works as expected. It's easy to make the mistake of setting the `vF` register
first, and then performing the mathematical operation. If you do that, however,
`vF` will not hold the right value anymore at calculation time and your maths
will be off when using that register as an input.

The top part (that starts with "HAPPY" for "happy path") checks the behaviour of
the following opcodes, in the case where we **don't** expect an overflow, carry
or shifted out bit:

```
HAPPY  8XY1   8XY2
8XY3   8XY4   8XY5
8XY6   8XY7   8XYE
```

* `8XY1` - `vX |= vY`
* `8XY2` - `vX &= vY`
* `8XY3` - `vX ^= vY`
* `8XY4` - `vX += vY`
* `8XY5` - `vX -= vY`
* `8XY6` - `vY >>= vX` or `vX >>= vX` depending on version
* `8XY7` - `vY =- vX`
* `8XYE` - `vY <<= vX` or `vX <<= vX` depending on version

The bottom part (that starts with "CRY" for "carry") checks behaviour of the following
opcodes, in the case that there **is** an overflow, carry or shifted out bit:

```
CRY  8XY4   8XY5
8XY6     8XY7
8XYE
```

* `8XY4` - `vX += vY`
* `8XY5` - `vX -= vY`
* `8XY6` - `vY >>= vX` or `vX >>= vX` depending on version
* `8XY7` - `vY =- vX`
* `8XYE` - `vY <<= vX` or `vX <<= vX` depending on version

The second half of the last row (from "OTHER") checks that the opcode `FX1E` properly
adds the value of register `vX` to the index register. For this test, only the
value is checked as overflow of the index register is not really defined in
CHIP-8 (and no ROMs rely on it as far as I know).

for more information on the arithmetic operations and the flags.

### Quirks test

CHIP-8, SCHIP and XO-CHIP have subtle differences in the way they interpret the
bytecode. We often call these differences quirks. This test detects which quirks
your interpreter implements, and if those quirks match the platform you're
trying to target. This is one of the hardest parts to "get right" and often a
reason why "some games work, but some don't".

The test asks you to choose the platform you are targeting:

![Choosing a target platform in the quirks test](./pictures/quirks-platform.png)

This menu works exactly the same as the main menu in terms of
[controls](#controls).

The test will now run through a couple of steps, which you will see on the
screen as some garbage and a flickering pixel. After about two seconds, you
should see this screen:

![Showing the active quirks](./pictures/quirks.png)

The screen shows you if the following quirks are detected as active ("on", "off"
or "err" if inconsistent or broken) and if that matches your chosen target
platform (a checkmark or a cross).

* `vF reset` - The AND, OR and XOR opcodes (`8XY1`, `8XY2` and `8XY3`) reset the
  flags register to zero
* `Memory` - The save and load opcodes (`FX55` and `FX65`) increment the index
  register (more information [here](https://laurencescotford.com/chip-8-on-the-cosmac-vip-loading-and-saving-variables/) and [here](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/#fx55-and-fx65-store-and-load-memory))
* `Display wait` - Drawing sprites to the display waits for the vertical blank
  interrupt, limiting their speed to max 60 sprites per second (more information
  [here](https://laurencescotford.com/chip-8-on-the-cosmac-vip-drawing-sprites/))
* `Clipping` - Sprites drawn at the bottom edge of the screen get clipped instead
  of wrapping around to the top of the screen. When clipping is off, the test
  checks if sprites get rendered at the right coordinates on the other side of
  the screen. This also tests that sprites drawn at coordinates of `x > 63`
  and/or `y > 31` are rendered at `x % 64` and `y % 32`. If any of these checks
  fail, the test will show `ERR` (more information
  [here](https://laurencescotford.com/chip-8-on-the-cosmac-vip-drawing-sprites/))
* `Shifting` - The shift opcodes (`8XY6` and `8XYE`) only operate on `vX`
  instead of storing the shifted version of `vY` in `vX` (more information
  [here](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/#8xy6-and-8xye-shift))
* `Jumping` - The "jump to some address plus `v0`" instruction (`BNNN`) doesn't
  use `v0`, but `vX` instead where `X` is the highest nibble of `NNN` (more
  information [here](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/#bnnn-jump-with-offset))

Note that you need timer support for this test to run.

See this [excellent
table](https://games.gulrak.net/cadmium/chip8-opcode-table.html) by Gulrak for
an overview of all the known quirks for the relatively popular CHIP-8 versions.
See [this website](https://chip-8.github.io/extensions/) for a lot more
information about all the historical versions of the platform and the different
quirks among them.

#### Auto starting

To auto-start this test, load the value `4` into memory at `0x1FF` and load the
ROM in memory starting from `0x200`. Additionally, you can also force the target
platform by loading a value between 1 and 3 into memory at the address `0x1FE`
(`510`).

### Keypad test

This test allows you to test all three CHIP-8 key input opcodes. It shows you a
little menu, asking which opcode you would like to test:

![Choosing the opcode to test in the keypad test](./pictures/keypad-menu.png)

#### 1. `EX9E DOWN`

`EX9E` skips the next instruction if the key indicated in `vX` is currently
pressed. In the test, when you press a key, the corresponding value lights up on
the screen.

![The `EX9E` keypad test, when pressing keys 1 and 6](./pictures/keypad-down.png)

_Pressing keys 1 and 6_

#### 2. `EXA1 UP`

`EXA1` skips the next instruction if the key indicated in `vX` is currently
**not** pressed. In the test, when you are **not** pressing a key, the
corresponding value lights up on the screen.

![The `EXA1` keypad test, when pressing keys 1 and 6](./pictures/keypad-up.png)

_Pressing keys 1 and 6_

#### 3. `FX0A GETKEY`

`FX0A` waits for a key press and returns the pressed key in `vX`.

The test asks you to press a key on the CHIP-8 keypad. When you do, it checks
for two issues that are easy to accidentally introduce when implementing this
opcode. If all is well, you should be seeing a checkmark and "all good" on the
screen:

![The `FX0A` keypad test, when all is good](./pictures/keypad-getkey.png)

Otherwise, you can get either of these errors:

* `NOT HALTING` - Your implementation immediately returns the value of any
  currently pressed keys in `vX`, instead of halting the interpreter until a key
  is pressed (note that this needs timer support to be accurate)
* `NOT RELEASED` - Your implementation doesn't wait for the pressed key to be
  released before resuming

See [this
article](https://laurencescotford.com/chip-8-on-the-cosmac-vip-keyboard-input/)
for more information.

#### Auto starting

To auto-start this test, load the value `5` into memory at `0x1FF` and load the
ROM in memory starting from `0x200`. Additionally, you can also force the target
opcode by loading a value between 1 and 3 into memory at the address `0x1FE`
(510).
